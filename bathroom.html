<title>New bathrooms in Blackburn South</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
Work is renovation of two side-by-side bathrooms in a house in Blackburn South. Work should start on 5 September 2023 (a day 
after settlement) but site inspection can be done some time in early July (to be announced later).
</p>
<p>
The longer-term plan is to rebuild the whole house within 2 years, so for now we just want something simple and inexpensive.

<h3>Bathroom 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove toilet, bathtub and vanity</li>
<li>Repaint drywalls</li>
<li>Install new shower (900mm x 1200mm or longer) (we don't want a bathtub), toilet and vanity</li>
<li>Install wall tiles only on the wall inside the shower and on top of the vanity</li>
<li>Can we keep the current floor tiles?</li>
</ul>

The floor plans for the new bathrooms are shown in Figures 7a and 7b. Either is fine, 7a is preferred if the price difference 
is not substantial. 7b keeps the current layout.

The current bathrooms have a window, and bathroom 1 will have a shower on the same wall as the window. Figure 8 shows
a sample shower with two support braces. The upper brace is 72cm from the ceiling, low enough to get around the window.
